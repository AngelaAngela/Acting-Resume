        <p>In the early moments of the 1980s, my cousins were my babysitters. My brother and I would go their house and
          play and raise Hell. Also, they had cable TV. Specifically they had MTV. Having access to music videos greatly
          affected my life. I wanted to be in the music videos. I wanted to play the music. I wanted to live inside the
          TV with the characters. That lasting impact has stayed with me throughout my life. </p>

        <p>In the 1990s, when our family purchased a camcorder, my brother and I started making home movies, music
          videos and improv videos. Then we found friends in high school who also wanted to make videos with us. In the
          early 2000s, my involvement in music and video making converged when my brother and I started our performance
          group Johnny Headband. Later I joined the music group Electric Six.</p>

        <p> Throughout all of my time performing music on stage, in videos and on records, Iâ€™ve also acted in short
          films. A selection of those videos and short films can be found here.</p>
